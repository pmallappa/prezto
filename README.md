Prezto — Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for Zsh it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

This is my personal fork of the original by @sorin-ionescu – you should fork and modify his repository if you're interested in using Prezto. Installation and usage instructions can also be found on his page https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto
